    <li><a href="http://OpenReview.net">OpenReview.net</a> is hosting reviewing for ICLR 2017, as well as the upcoming UAI 2017.</li>
    <li><a href="http://factorie.cs.umass.edu">FACTORIE</a> is a toolkit for deployable probabilistic modeling, implemented as a software library in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. It provides its users with a succinct language for creating relational factor graphs, estimating parameters and performing inference.
