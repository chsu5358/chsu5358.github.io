### Entity Resolution

#### [Wikilinks Dataset](/data/data-wiki-links) [large-scale entity resolution, cross-document coreference]
Identifying and disambiguating a large set of mentions from the web using Wikipedia. The data contains ~40 million mentions referring to ~3 million entities, extracted from ~10 million webpages.


#### [BibTex Dataset](/data/data-bibtex) [large-scale entity resolution]
Publicly-available BibTex files that can be used for large-scale entity resolution. The dataset contains more than a million author mentions.


#### [Cora Citation Matching](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/cora-refs.tar.gz) [reference matching, object correspondence]
Text of citations hand-clustered into groups referring to the same paper.

### Information Extraction

#### [UMass Citation Field Extraction Dataset](/data/data-umasscitationfield)
Citation field extraction dataset provides labels and segments for extracted citations from articles from many different academic 
disciplines.


#### [Cora Information Extraction](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/cora-ie.tar.gz)
Research paper headers and citations, with labeled segments for authors, title, institutions, venue, date, page numbers and several other fields.


#### [CMU Seminar Announcements](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/sa-tagged.tar.gz)
48 emailed seminar announcements, with labeled segments for speaker, title, start-time, end-time. Labeled by Dayne Freitag.

### Document Classification

#### [SRAA](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/sraa.tar.gz): Simulated/Real/Aviation/Auto UseNet data
73,218 UseNet articles from four discussion groups, for simulated auto racing, simulated aviation, real autos, real aviation. I have often used this data for binary classification---separating real from simulated, and auto from aviation---making the point that the same data can be classified different ways depending on the user's needs. This is especially interesting for semi-supervised learning. This data was gathered by Andrew McCallum while at Just Research.


#### [Cora Research Paper Classification](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/cora-classify.tar.gz) [relational document classification]
Research papers classified into a topic hierarchy with 73 leaves. We call this a relational data set, because the citations provide relations among papers.


#### [Industry Sector](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/sector.tar.gz)
Corporate web pages classified into a topic hierarchy with about 70 leaves.


#### [20 Newsgroups](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/data/20_newsgroups.tar.gz)
About 20,000 UseNet postings from 20 newsgroups. Gathered by Ken Lang at CMU in the mid-90's. This is the original set, without various editing done by Jason Rennie and others.
